# Mastermind

## Description

This is my first attempt at programming in SWIFT. I have always been a fan of the game MasterMind and when I typically learn a new programming language, this is my go-to game because of the logic used. As I learn the language, I will update the code to make it more efficient.

Please take a look and provide whatever constructive criticism you may have to help me learn.

I hope you enjoy the game!
