# MASTERMIND

Code-breaking game adapted from the popular version of Mastermind for one player, playing against the operating system.


## About Me

I am a self-taught amatuer programmer that likes to learn new things. This is my first attempt at programming in SWIFT. I have always been a fan of the game MasterMind and when I typically learn a new programming language, this is my go-to game to learn the fundamentals because of the logic used. As I learn the language, I will update the code to make it more efficient and succinct.

Please take a look and provide whatever constructive criticism you may have to help me learn.

I hope you enjoy the game!


## Additional Information

Mastermind or Master Mind is a code-breaking game for two players. The modern game with pegs was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert. It resembles an earlier pencil and paper game called Bulls and Cows that may date back a century.
